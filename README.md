# Mod 1 Project: Gamertag 

This is a Ruby based CLI project built in hopes that it will one day be of service to gamers everywhere. The name "Gamertab" is based around the idea of being able to keep online "tabs" of all your gaming systems, games and (soon enough) reviews. I hope you find it useful and are as optimistic as I am for the growth and future of it. Built by Dan Reeves, a programmer on the rise in the tech field. 

# Instructions 

1. Fork and clone my(Dan's) Repository
2. Once into the file, run it with ruby bin/run.rb to get to the main menu.
3. Make yourself a profile, then run the file again to add any games or systems.(Reviews coming soon!)
4. Follow the prompts on whatever you are trying to do within the app and have fun!
